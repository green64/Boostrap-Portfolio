# Bootstrap Portfolio

**Object**
Recreate the basic portfolio from assignment 1 using Bootstrap to make it responsive.

***Technology Used***
HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap

In assignment one, we created a non-responsive browser. You can view it on your phone, but you might have a finger cramp from moving around on the huge content area by the time you find what you're looking for. Why? Because it doesn't shrink -- even if your viewport does. 

This version of my portfolio utilizes several pre-defined Bootstrap page elements, such as the navigation bar and form. 

I enjoyed learning the basics of Bootstrap and look forwarding to taking a deeper dive on subsequent projects.
