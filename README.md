[Bootstrap-Portfolio](https://green64.github.io/Bootstrap-Portfolio/)

In assignment one, we created a non-responsive browser. You can view it on your phone, but you might have a finger cramp from moving around on the huge by the time you find what you're looking for.

This version of my portfolio utilizes several pre-defined Bootstrap page elements, such as the navigation bar. 

I enjoyed learning the basics of Bootstrap and look forwarding to taking a deeper dive on subsequent projects.
